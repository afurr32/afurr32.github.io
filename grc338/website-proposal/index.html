					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>When Kathy was a University of San Francisco professor in 1981, one of her students was skilled in the beautiful art of candle carving, an art which she desired to acquire. Slow Burn Candles started selling candles seasonally and within one year turned into a full time business. Kathy even taught her daughter how to dip and carve candles. Numerous malls in Central California became the venue for Kathy’s candle carving demonstrations. For many years the candle factory at Knott’s Berry Farm was operated by Kathy and her family. Kathy's daughter, Annika, now runs the family business and upon moving to the Central Coast in November 2019 with her Austrailian Sheppard, Bo, Downtown San Luis Obispo became the location of what is now known as “SLO Burn Candles”.</p>

                <h1>Sustainability</h1>
                <p>Caring for our environment and our customers is our top priority at SLO Burn Candles. All of our candles and materials are sourced locally and then produced in San Luis Obispo at our shop. We even grow our own herbs on our outdoor patio at the shop! You can catch our candlemakers in our shop 7 days a week making beautiful candles and molds. We use all natural beeswax and organic fragrances and dyes so no toxins are released into the atmosphere, and also preventing our customers from breathing in harmful substances. We also use fully recycled containers for our candles either provided by our customers or local antique and thrift stores. Our Give Back program allows for our customers to receive a 35% discount on their candle purchases when they bring in their own glass container. Plus, customers can recycle the glass when all the wax is gone to use as a cup or make another candle in.</p>
