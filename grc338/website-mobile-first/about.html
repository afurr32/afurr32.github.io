                With a lifelong passion for cooking and hospitality, Megan Popovich has spent most of her career working in some of California’s most distinguished fine dining establishments. After graduating with a degree in Chemistry from
                Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Megan continued on as a fine dining chef for restaurants all around the Bay Area and Napa Valley. Her career brought her to work in a number of Michelin-rated establishments. Megan always had a
                dream of one day opening up a fully female-owned and run café, where she could showcase her love and passion for cooking. Megan hopes to open up a Meggy Lou's in her hometown of Sonora, CA someday as well.
